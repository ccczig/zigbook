Run the command zig translate-c main.c to get the equivalent Zig code output to your console (stdout). You may wish to pipe this into a file with zig translate-c main.c > int_sort.zig (warning for Windows users: piping in PowerShell will produce a file with the incorrect encoding - use your editor to correct this).
