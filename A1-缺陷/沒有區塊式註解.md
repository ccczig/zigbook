# zig 沒有區塊是註解

所以在 vscode 中，要先圈選後，用 Ctrl+/ 來加整塊註解

若要解除整塊註解就再按一次  Ctrl+/ 


## zig 為何沒有 Block Comments (區塊式註解)

參考 https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/161

Status quo:

Multiline comments start with /* and end with */, and they nest. The name "multiline" is a bit misleading, because in fact, these style of comments have power that single line comments do not have, which is ability to insert in the middle of an expression:

const sum = a + /* comment */ b;
Removing multiline comments would remove this ability.

Rationale:

Modern text editors make it easy to insert some characters in front of many lines at once; commenting out a block of code by prefixing each line with // should be easy.

One of the points of contention in C is whether to use /* */ or // for comments. Only having one way to do things is one of Zig's goals.
